# Project Spectrum

**Exploring the survival of microorganisms in the stratosphere**

Team Spectrum is a student-led scientific initiative focused on studying the resilience of microorganisms in extreme environments. By sending biological samples into the stratosphere, we aim to investigate their survival under high-altitude conditions. Our mission integrates biology, engineering, and atmospheric science in a hands-on research context.

## Objectives

- Secure research funding and grants (finished)
- Develop and construct a viable stratospheric payload (finished) 
- Execute a high-altitude launch from Boston  (finished)
- Analyze survival rates of biological test subjects post-flight (ongoing)

## Main-Project Focus

We are currently studying the survival of *Paramecium*, a unicellular freshwater organism, in simulated stratospheric conditions. This includes environmental stress testing, data collection, and post-exposure analysis. We didnt get to launch it with our payload, because the airline lost and brought our luggage late.

## Side-Project Focus

A mechanism that aims to drop pieces of paper (including stickers!). It is powered by a servo motor that is alligned on a gear rail. In Testing, it worked fine.

## Progress Overview

Our team has made substantial progress in several core areas:

- Conducted literature reviews and initial scientific research  
- Produced payload sketches and early-stage prototypes  
- Developed foundational code and testing tools  
- Participated in technical planning and concept discussions

## Documentation

Documentation and related files are currently being updated and reorganized. They will be made publicly available once finalized.
