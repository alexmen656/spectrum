1. Using bacteria will likely be very challenging and probably not possible due to our time restrictions, even if we got support from a local university offering us a laboratory, which I think is unlikely by itself.
2. What we should do instead is use 1-celled organisms like paramecium, which are much easier to work with and easily visible under a common optical microscope. 
3. We should try having many small samples (like 10 or 20) on the payload to be able to verify our results. 
4. Evaluating survival rates mid-flight might not be possible as microorganisms usually require a microscope to be observed properly, which we cant have on the payload because of weight limitations
5. instead we will evaluate survival rates after the flight
6. We can still track variables like temperature inside our payload, to see under what conditions the organisms were


**Other notes about meeting**
We were shown around the laboratory and introduced to some devices, like fluorescence microscopes. However, this is not important to our project as much since they are way beyond our budget so we wont be using them.
