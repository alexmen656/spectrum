Currently, from my research, we should be using TTC salt inside of our agar which Alive bacteria will transform into red crystals. By the growth rate of these crystals, we can tell how many bacteria are alive and active. Once the spots stop increasing in size or significantly slow down, there are two possible scnerios:
1. The Bacteria have started dieing and therefore became inactive
2. The Bacteria became inactive due to sporulation
To know which of these it is, we will hae to do a post-flight analysis of the petri dish using a microscope. We can add Erythrosin B to the sample then, which would stain all dead bacteria, letting us observe the difference between alive and dead bacteria (since usually they look practically the same) If the bacteria Sporulated, we would see no red spots growing during flight and no erythrosin B stained bacteria (or at least not that many). If the bacteria dies, we will see no red spots growing but they will be stained by the dye and therefore we will be able to identify them. Finally, if they survived we will see the red spots growing during the flight or at least after it, and we will not see them being dyed by the Erythrosin B.

**Note #1:** We keep changing our plan daily, we should really get something set
**Note #2:** I need to read over this tomorrow once more, its past midnight
